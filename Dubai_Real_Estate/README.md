## Dubai Real Estate Price Prediction Challenge

Leverage property-specific features like location, size, proximity to landmarks, transaction data, and economic indicators such as GDP, inflation, and interest rates to build machine learning models for forecasting rental and selling prices. Discover the interplay between property attributes, market trends, and economic factors to drive accurate pricing and informed decisions.

Analyze Dubai's real estate market by exploring transaction data and macroeconomic factors to predict property rental and sale prices. Participants will perform exploratory data analysis to uncover trends, correlations between property attributes and economic indicators, and key drivers of price fluctuations.

Leveraging these insights, participants will build machine learning models to estimate property prices, starting with real estate data alone and then integrating additional datasets. Model performance will be assessed to measure the impact of external factors, providing a deeper understanding of how trends shape market outcomes. Participants will also present strategic recommendations for real estate investors, with an added challenge to identify undervalued properties with high investment potential.

The challenge winner's models will be featured in the inaugural business application developed from a data challenge: the "Dubai Real Estate dApp." This presents a unique opportunity to earn recurring revenue after the competition.
