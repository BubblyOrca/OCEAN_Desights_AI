## Dubai Real Estate Price Prediction Challenge

Leverage property-specific features like location, size, proximity to landmarks, transaction data, and economic indicators such as GDP, inflation, and interest rates to build machine learning models for forecasting rental and selling prices. Discover the interplay between property attributes, market trends, and economic factors to drive accurate pricing and informed decisions.

Analyze Dubai's real estate market by exploring transaction data and macroeconomic factors to predict property rental and sale prices. Participants will perform exploratory data analysis to uncover trends, correlations between property attributes and economic indicators, and key drivers of price fluctuations.

Leveraging these insights, participants will build machine learning models to estimate property prices, starting with real estate data alone and then integrating additional datasets. Model performance will be assessed to measure the impact of external factors, providing a deeper understanding of how trends shape market outcomes. Participants will also present strategic recommendations for real estate investors, with an added challenge to identify undervalued properties with high investment potential.

The challenge winner's models will be featured in the inaugural business application developed from a data challenge: the "Dubai Real Estate dApp." This presents a unique opportunity to earn recurring revenue after the competition.

## Exploratory Data Analysis
30 points
Examine the provided Dubai real estate data - sales and rental transactions only - to uncover key insights and trends. Support your findings with relevant visualizations. (10 points)

Utilize the additional datasets to identify macroeconomic factors, such as GDP, tourism, population, and energy, that may impact the real estate market. (10 points)

Explore the correlations between these macroeconomic factors and property sale or rental prices. Highlight the most significant factors driving market behavior. (10 points)

## Machine Learning Models
40 points
Develop two models using only the real estate transaction data:
a. One to estimate property sale prices.
b. Another to estimate property rental prices. (15 points)

Create two additional models incorporating both real estate data and supplementary datasets:
a. One to estimate property sale prices.
b. Another to estimate property rental prices. (15 points)

Evaluate the performance of all four models using metrics such as RMSE, MSE, and RÂ². Analyze whether the inclusion of additional data enhances model accuracy. (10 points)

You should at least train your model on these 9 features but you are free to add more:
Property Type or/and Property Sub Type
Number of rooms/bedrooms
Property Size (sq.m)
Area/Neighborhood
Nearest Metro
Nearest Mall
Nearest Landmark
Usage (commercial/residential)
Average prices the previous month/week (for the same kind of property)
