## Formula 1 Racing Challenge: 2024 Strategy Analysis

This challenge invites data scientists to perform an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the 2024 Formula 1 season, focusing on pit stop strategies, tire usage, and race performance. Participants will use detailed lap-by-lap data to explore patterns and relationships influencing race outcomes, providing valuable insights into the strategic decisions made by teams and drivers throughout the season.

## Instructions

The 2024 Formula 1 Season Data Challenge involves analyzing a comprehensive dataset that includes every lap from all 2024 races. Participants will focus on strategic decisions related to pit stops, tire choices, and race management and explore correlations between key variables.

The dataset offers detailed information, including lap times, tire compounds, stint lengths, pit stop timings, and race positions. Participants will identify and interpret patterns in the data, such as how race length impacts strategy or the influence of tire compounds on lap times. Additionally, the challenge includes exploring relationships like how tire choice and pit stop timing affect final race outcomes.

The analysis will reveal how different strategies were employed across various races and provide insights into the factors influencing race outcomes. By working with this detailed dataset, participants will contribute to a better understanding of race strategy in Formula 1 and showcase their data science skills in a real-world context.

Participants will demonstrate their analytical abilities through both EDA and correlation analysis. The findings could potentially inform future decisions in the sport and contribute to a broader understanding of race strategy in Formula 1.
